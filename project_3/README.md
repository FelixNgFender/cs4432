# CS 4432 Project 3: Join and Aggregation Algorithms

Author: Thinh Nguyen - 670714455

## Get started

`make test` to run the default test.

`make test > tmp.txt` to run the default test and save the output to `tmp.txt`.

`make run` will compile the `main` executable in the `./bin` directory.

`make` alone compiles the executable and copies over the test data to the build
directory.

`make clean` to clean up compiled files, and test copies.

## Test results

Everything works as expected. Aggregate functionality was cross-checked by
calculating if the sum results times the count equals to the average results.

## Design decisions

Nothing outside of the guidelines.

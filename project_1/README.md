## Get started

`TODO: how to compile and execute your code.`

`make test` will compile the `scheduler` executable and move it to the expected
location of `run_tests.sh` (i.e., top-level directory).run_tests.sh
`./run_tests.sh` to run the tests.

`make` alone compiles the `scheduler` executable in `./bin`.

`make clean` to clean up compiled files and test output files.

`make workloads` to test all 5 novel workloads.

`make workload-[1..5]` to test a specific workload.

## Test results

Section II: section on test results. A test case will be provided along with the
expected output. This test case will help you testing your code. In the
Readme.txt file state which of the test case commands is successfully working
and which ones are failing. This will help TAs to better test your code and give
you fair grades

## Design decisions

Section III: section describes any design decisions that you do beyond the
design guidelines given in this document. For example, any additional variables
or methods or classes that you add.
